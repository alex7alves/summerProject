# Summer Project 2017

<p>This is a project that aims to build a simulation game in the real world. I am aiming to build a game that is similar to <b>Cities Skylines</b>. Right now I am thinking using an OV7670 camera with 2.4GHz interface to an Intel Edison. Then using a self driving car program to do machine learning. I hope it will work out.</p>
